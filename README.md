# Recent Grads Earnings Based on College Majors
In this project, we will explore the earnings of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012.  
The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey. FiveThirtyEigth cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.  
This is one of my projects on Dataquest.
